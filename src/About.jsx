        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-blue-500">üîß How it works:</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
            This project uses the famous Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. 
            Each location acts as a node, and the connections (roads) between them act as weighted edges representing distance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
            When a user enters a start and end location, the app runs Dijkstra's algorithm on the internal graph structure to compute the most efficient path and displays the result along with the total distance.
        </p>
